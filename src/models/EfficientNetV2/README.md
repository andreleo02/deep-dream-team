For the first time, with EfficientNet, a new approach has been introduced: compound scaling. This approach focuses on the simultaneous scaling of all three dimensions of a neural network (width, depth and resolution of the input), rather than on a single dimension alone. In the Efficient Net, three constant coefficients are determined by conducting a small grid search on the model. The depth (d), the width (w) represented by and finally the image size (r). These three values are scaled by a compound coefficient Phi.
